[Go-Nav on Netify](https://go-nav.netlify.app/)

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Develop and deploy to netify
When branch main is updated, netify will update the site automatically.
Use `dev` branch to draft.
Run `git rebase dev main` to sync dev to main.
Then push main to github.

### Installation

$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
